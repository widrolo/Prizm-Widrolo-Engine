(Collision check crashes the system when more than 2 objects are inside the box array)
[
    Suspicious Areas:
    1. core/Collision.h : 101 : collided = true;

    Suspected Reason:
    It apperas as if code 1 crashes after setting collided to true.
    This makes no sense, because it should always run without crashing
    after having to process a "mov" instruction...
