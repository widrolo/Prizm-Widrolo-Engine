[ ] - Save Game (File IO and Game Mode needed)
    In the Gamemode, there will be a buffer of a given size, that holds a certain
    number of the SaveItem object. Uppon saving, all SaveItem objects will be 
    packaged and saved to a file with a given name ending with .wsv.
    The programmer can access the save buffer at any given possible time.
[ ] - Data Files (File IO)
    Any game using the Widrolo Engine will always be able to access .wdt files for 
    aditional data. Data comes in 1024 byte blocks, and cannot be written to by the game
    itself, but must be created using a custom data to wdt converter.
