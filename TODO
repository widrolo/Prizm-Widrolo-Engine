Primary:
[O] - Collision
[O] - Sprites
[O] - Trigger zones (requires Collision)
[O] - Game Mode base
[O] - Pawn Class
[O] - UI (requires Sprites for smaller font)
[/] - Game Reset (requires Game Mode base)
[O] - Random
[O] - Sprite optimization (h/v-filping)
[O] - File IO
[ ] - Save Game (File IO and Game Mode needed)
    In the Gamemode, there will be a buffer of a given size, that holds a certain
    number of the SaveItem object. Uppon saving, all SaveItem objects will be 
    packaged and saved to a file with a given name ending with .wsv.
    The programmer can access the save buffer at any given possible time.
[ ] - Data Files (File IO)
    Any game using the Widrolo Engine will always be able to access .wdt files for 
    aditional data. Data comes in 1024 byte blocks, and cannot be written to by the game
    itself, but must be created using a custom data to wdt converter. 

Secondary:
[O] - Anti Piracy
[ ] - Anti Piracy V2 (Requires File IO)
    On boot the game will check for a anti piracy file.
    That file is called something like SYSTEM.SYS to make it more legit.
    If the file doesnt exist, then the game will ask the user for a Password,
    and based on if its true or false, it will modify the file accordingly.
    Is the file present, and its contants are right, then the game will boot.
    Is the file present, but the contents are wrong, then the game will throw an anti piracy screen.

[ ] - Tool for converting data to a .wdt file
