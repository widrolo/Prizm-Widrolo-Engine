[ ] - Anti Piracy V2 (Requires File IO)
    On boot the game will check for a anti piracy file.
    That file is called something like SYSTEM.SYS to make it more legit.
    If the file doesnt exist, then the game will ask the user for a Password,
    and based on if its true or false, it will modify the file accordingly.
    Is the file present, and its contants are right, then the game will boot.
    Is the file present, but the contents are wrong, then the game will throw an anti piracy screen.

[O] - Tool for converting ppm to color arrays
